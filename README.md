# JavaScript General Practice

This repository is my personal playground for practicing and improving my JavaScript skills. It contains various exercises and small projects that I've worked on to reinforce different JavaScript concepts.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To provide a space for hands-on JavaScript practice
2. To experiment with different JavaScript features and concepts
3. To track my progress and growth in JavaScript programming

## Structure

The repository consists of multiple JavaScript files, each focusing on a specific concept, challenge, or mini-project. These files cover a range of topics from basic operations to more complex problem-solving tasks.

## How I Use This Repo

- I regularly add new JavaScript files as I explore new concepts or come across interesting challenges.
- I revisit and refactor older code as my skills improve, allowing me to see my progress over time.
- This serves as a personal reference for various JavaScript implementations I've worked on.
